# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
The goal of this project was to create a webpage containing notes from the prework for later use. This project was built in order to create an easy-to-read webpage that is organized with the key points from the prework modules and demonstrates the lessons contained from the modules as well. The webpage itself will be important towards studying basic concepts for future projects and organizes everything to be easily accessed at a later date. I was able to learn how to navigate through GitHub and sync the data from the local desktop onto the project repository as well as learn about three languages that work in unison to makeup a webpage.
